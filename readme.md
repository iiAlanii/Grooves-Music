### Discord.js Music bot, Grooves Music

# Grooves Music

> Note that is was one of the first music bots I made. So clearly there won't be many commands regarding **dj, premium commands, spotify/soundcloud,etc support**
Though if you do have any problems, submit an issue report and I will help you out.


## Features:

✓ 10+ Music Commands

✓ 10+ Filters

✓ Works on Replit.com and any vps
